## System Architecture
The SkillScroll ed-tech platform consists of three main components: the front end, the back end, and the database. The platform follows a client-server architecture, with the front end serving as the client and the back end and database serving as the server.

## Front-end
The front end of the platform is built using ReactJS, which is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. ReactJS allows for the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces, which are critical for providing an engaging learning experience to the students. The front end communicates with the back end using RESTful API calls.

## Back-end
The back end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, which are popular frameworks for building scalable and robust server-side applications. The back end provides APIs for the front end to consume, which include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

## Database
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, which is a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data, which is useful for storing course content such as videos, images, and PDFs. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.

## API Design
The SkillScroll platform's API is designed following the REST architectural style. The API is implemented using Node.js and Express.js. It uses JSON for data exchange and follows standard HTTP request methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

### Sample list of API endpoints and their functionalities:
- `/api/auth/signup` (POST): Create a new user (student or instructor) account.
- `/api/auth/login` (POST) â€“ Log in using existing credentials and generate a JWT token.
- `/api/auth/verify-otp` (POST) - Verify the OTP sent to the user's registered email.
- `/api/auth/forgot-password` (POST) - Send an email with a password reset link to the registered email.
- `/api/courses` (GET) - Get a list of all available courses.
- `/api/courses/:id` (GET) - Get details of a specific course by ID.
- `/api/courses` (POST) - Create a new course.
- `/api/courses/:id` (PUT) - Update an existing course by ID.
- `/api/courses/:id` (DELETE) - Delete a course by ID.
- `/api/courses/:id/rate` (POST) - Add a rating (out of 5) to a course.


### Sample API Request and responses:
- GET `/api/courses`: Get all courses
-- Response: A list of all courses in the database
- GET `/api/courses/:id`: Get a single course by ID
-- Response: The course with the specified ID
- POST `/api/courses`: Create a new course
-- Request: The course details in the request body
-- Response: The newly created course
- PUT `/api/courses/`:id: Update an existing course by ID
-- Request: The updated course details in the request body
-- Response: The updated course
- DELETE `/api/courses/`:id: Delete a course by ID
-- Response: A success message indicating that the course has been deleted.

## Future Enhancements
This section discusses potential future improvements to the SkillScroll platform. These enhancements are listed along with an explanation of how they would improve the platform and priority for implementation.
1. Gamification features: Adding gamification features such as badges, points, and leaderboards can increase user engagement and motivation. This would be a medium-priority enhancement.
2. Personalized learning paths: Creating personalized learning paths for each student based on their interests and learning style can increase student satisfaction and success. This would be a high-priority enhancement.
3. Social learning features: Adding social learning features such as group discussions, peer-to-peer feedback, and collaborative projects can increase student engagement and interaction. This would be a medium-priority enhancement.
4. Mobile app: Creating a mobile app for the platform would allow for more convenient access to course content and features, and would increase the platform's reach. This would be a high-priority enhancement.
5. Machine learning-powered recommendations: Using machine learning algorithms to provide personalized course recommendations can improve student engagement and satisfaction. This would be a medium to high-priority enhancement.
6. Virtual reality/augmented reality integration: Adding virtual reality or augmented reality components to certain courses can enhance the learning experience and make it more immersive. This would be low to medium-priority enhancement.
